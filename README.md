# ORAL DIAGNOSTICS AID
## Description 
This machine analyzes full set of teeth in the frontal position and diagnosis problems like spacing, crowding, over bite, under bite or lack thereof. It can analyze pictures as well as live images and yield a relatively accurate diagnosis given that the teeth are properly in range and in proper position in view. 
## Use Case
This is machine would ideally be used by dental students in training to study and understand the different teeth conditions in humans. 
## Scope of the Project
In the future, this could be developed further to analyze oral diseases along side teeth deformities and could potentially save patients from having their potential oral health concerns and issues go untreated for too long.
